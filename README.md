### About the App

  - True Tune is a Web Radio App where you can find exceptional radio stations!
  
  - You can see all radios in a GridView, so you can get quickly to the music you love. Or you can filter by your favorite radios, always a safe choice.
  
  - Not sure what is your mood at the moment? Hear a preview of any radio by pressing a radio grid item on the GridView Page. Choose the best song playing all across included radios!
  
  - The App was designed to be user-friendly and intuitive, with a simple but appealing interface. There are custom animations developed to ease the interaction and provide reliable feedback.
